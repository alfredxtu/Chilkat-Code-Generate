# Chilkat-Code-Generate
Code for Generating Wrappers to Support Other Programming Languages

This project contains the complete Chilkat API specifications in XML format, as well as a simple class library that could be
used to generate wrappers for other programming languages.  (Chilkat currently generates the wrappers for all supported
programming languages (such as C++, Java, C#, Perl, Ruby, Objective-C, C, Python, ActiveX, etc.)

For example, there has been interest to generate a wrapper for the AutoIT scripting language, such that the wrapper code would
make calls to the ActiveX.  This project gives one the power to do that.  

If there is activity and interest, then this project will continue to evolve.
